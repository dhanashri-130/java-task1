The Java Console Calculator is a basic menu-driven application developed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts in Java. The objective of this project is to design and implement a calculator that performs essential arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, using console-based input and output.

The application is structured using a clean and modular approach, where each arithmetic operation is implemented as a separate method to enhance readability and maintainability. The program utilizes the Scanner class to accept user input and a do-while loop to allow multiple calculations within a single execution until the user chooses to exit. Conditional statements and a switch expression are used to handle operation selection efficiently.

The project is organized under the package com.elevatelab.calc and was developed using Java (JDK) in IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition. This implementation demonstrates understanding of object-oriented programming principles, method creation, control flow statements, user interaction handling, and basic software structuring practices.
